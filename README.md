# Reader Set GO!
 
Note: After some fairly catastrophic branch issues, this is a reclone of [the original repository](https://github.com/endlessashley/competitive-reading)

## Description

An application that challenges users to read the top 100 books across 5 genres. Users can add the books that they've completed to their bookshelf, where their challenge score is tallied. Users can also get a random book recommendation if they can't decide what to read next. 

Reader Set GO! is deployed on [Heroku](https://pure-dawn-95351.herokuapp.com/).

Reader Set GO! uses React, JavaScript, MongoDB/Mongoose, GraphQL, Apollo, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, JSX
